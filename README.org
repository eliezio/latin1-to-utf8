l1u8recode is a simple utility to recode files from ISO-8859-1 (latin1) to UTF8 that supports mixed encodings and/or formats.

It's able to handle these two special cases:

1. The recoding can be applied to delimited portions of the input. Useful for files that contains
both text and binary data, such as RCS files;
2. Preserves characters already converted to UTF-8. Handy when you have texts with mixed encodings.
Editing a file on different platforms can led it to this state.

I wrote this utility because both [[http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/][iconv]] and [[http://recode.progiciels-bpi.ca/][recode]],
the two most widely used recoders, only supports plain-text files with an uniform encoding.
